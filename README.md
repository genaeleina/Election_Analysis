# Election Analysis with Python and Visual Studios

## Overview of Project:
    This project takes election data and analyzes it for Seth and Tom. 

### Purpose
    Analyzes the election data through python to print it to a text document to determine winners.

## Analysis and Challenges
    Seth and Tom are running an audit on the election results. They have a csv with all results but they do not know who won, or what county had the most votes. The votes need to be analyzed in a way that they can be useful, including percentages per winner. Challenges arose from having things in the wrong folder to pull from but were quickly fixed when things were moved.

### Election Audit Results
    -Diana Degette won with 272,892 votes, or 73.8%
    -Denver had the most votes, meaning they had the largest turnout
    -The turnout in Denver was 306,055 votes or 82.8% of all votes 

### Election Audit Summary
    To the election commission: 
        This script can be used for other election audits, just replace the csv with another. If the columns are in the same order then you won't have to change the script. If you want to change the data you will have to update what columns they pull from. You could also easily look at new data in the same columns you would still be able to track voter turn out, for column 2, but if you are looking at a different area you will want to change the title to output something other than "Largest County Turnout." You can also track winners of other things if you put them in column 3. If you duplicated the code with new names you could continue with new columns and new data to figure out more statistics at a time.
